## My process

### Built with

- React.js
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my project using React.js and it was a good intro some basic React features. Although probably would have been easier and quicker to build this vanialla Javascript however I've started to learn React recently and this project has proven to be quite good help to understand the features in depth.
